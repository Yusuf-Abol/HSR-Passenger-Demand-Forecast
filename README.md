# High-Speed Rail Passenger Demand Forecast

 📊 A robust forecasting pipeline for daily transportation passenger counts, combining classical time series modeling with deep learning for superior accuracy and reliability.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project builds a **hybrid time series forecasting model** that blends the strengths of:
- **SARIMAX** (for trend and seasonality)
- **BiGRU** (for complex, non-linear patterns)

It’s designed for **operational planning, capacity forecasting, and resource optimization** in public transit systems.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Predict **daily passenger counts** with high accuracy  
- Understand and model **weekly and seasonal patterns**  
- Compare performance across multiple statistical and ML models  
- Enable future-ready extensions (e.g., external variables, real-time deployment)

---

## 📈 Data Summary

- **Timeframe:** 2012–2014  
- **Features:** Daily passenger counts  
- **Patterns Identified:**
  - 📅 Strong weekly cycle (Mon–Fri peaks)
  - 🌞 Summer surges (tourism effect)
  - 📈 Long-term upward trend

## 🧠 Models Compared

| Model              | RMSE     | MAPE     | Notes |
|-------------------|----------|----------|-------|
| Naïve              | ~173     | ~30–35%  | Baseline |
| SES                | 114.93   | 22.00%   | Simple smoothing |
| Holt Linear        | 105.92   | 26.84%   | Captures trend |
| Holt-Winters       | 111.59   | 22.81%   | Adds seasonality |
| ARIMA              | 115.77   | 22.20%   | Basic autoregression |
| SARIMAX            | 70.65    | 13.18%   | Strong seasonality capture |
| BiGRU              | 75.40    | 15.15%   | Learns nonlinear patterns |
| **Hybrid**         | **74.09**| **11.43%** | ✅ **Best overall performance** |

## 🏆 Why Hybrid Works

- **SARIMAX** handles repeating cycles (weekly, monthly) and long-term growth.
- **BiGRU** captures irregularities like spikes, holidays, and nonlinear changes.
- **Together**, they outperform every individual model in both absolute and relative error.
